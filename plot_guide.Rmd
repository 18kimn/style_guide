# Introduction


Data visualization is never purely objective. There is always a story we want to communicate, a trend we want to show above others, a subgroup we want to highlight — in all cases, an opinionated project with political goals. As a nonprofit using data for community action, DataHaven is driven by the need to make data accessible and interpretable, and to have our products used to advance justice, eliminate inequity, and promote the well-being of all. 

In this effort, we recognize that the styling and aesthetic portions of plots are just as substantive as the quantitative trends that we show, and everything about style must service this goal. 

In less abstract terms, this means that all of our plots should involve:

* Identifying trends in our data that we’d like to highlight.
* Selecting variables and measures that will display this in a meaningful and interpretable way. 
* Highlighting them through selective use of text, colors, and geoms. 

This style guide addresses the third point in detail, but the first and second point must be addressed for each plot that you make. 

DataHaven makes a ton of graphics of different topics, messages, and target audiences. As a result, there aren’t hard-and-fast rules for how big you should make your text, what your go-to colors would be, and so on. This style guide is still just a guide for how to think about effective presentation, with several examples to assist. 

# Text

Text is probably the most explicit way to communicate a message through your plot. There are also many different kinds and uses for text, and many characteristics to consider with each choice. Finally, considering that many of DataHaven’s graphics are public-facing and have broad audiences, a clear message through text is essential to making graphics accessible and interpretable.  

```{r}
text_guide <- read_csv("examples/text_guide.csv")

knitr::kable(text_guide)
```

Although these classifications are useful to think about, there often aren’t clear boundaries between different types of text. Legend text can often be changed into annotations, and information reserved for the caption in some areas might work better as a subtitle in other areas. You should feel no qualms about breaking any of these rules if they assist in the overall goal of providing a simple, accessible graphic with a clear message. 



```{r}
fake_data <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 5+.1*(1:10)^2, group = "group A") %>% 
  bind_rows(
    data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 10-(1:10)^.5, group = "group B"),
    data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 13-(1:10), group = "c")
  )

text_example_base <- fake_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, color = group)) + 
  annotate("text", x = 2, y = 6, color = "red", label = "Group C", size = 6) + 
  annotate("text", x = 2, y = 9.2, color = "blue", label = "Group B", size = 6) + 
  annotate("text", x = 2, y = 12.2, color = "black", label = "Group A", size = 6) + 
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("black","red", "blue")) + 
  labs(x = "Short X-axis title in size 14 plain font", 
       y = "Short Y-axis title", 
       title = "Concise conclusion in size 18 bolded font.", 
       subtitle = "Qualifier or description in size 14 plain font. Note the sentence case as opposed to title case.",
       caption = "Source: Connecticut Department of Fake Data. Nathan Kim, DataHaven.\nDescription of methods as needed on a new line."
       ) + 
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Source Sans Pro"), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 18 , face = "bold"), 
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14), 
        panel.background = element_blank(), 
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, size = 1),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14), 
        legend.position = "none", 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12), 
        legend.key = element_rect(fill = NA), 
        )

logo <- cowplot::ggdraw() + 
  cowplot::draw_image("examples/25th_logo_alpha.png", x = 0, hjust = 0, width = 0.25) +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(0.05, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05, "in"))

text_example_plot <- cowplot::plot_grid(text_example_base, logo,
                                   ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(10, 1))
ggsave("examples/text_plot.png", plot = text_example_plot, width = 8, height =6, dpi = 300)
```

#### A note on fonts 

Fonts for DataHaven graphics should be chosen in a “standard”-looking, clean,  very readable font. The DataHaven Community Wellbeing Index (CWI) reports use Barlow Semi Condensed and PT Sans. Roboto Condensed is another great one, and is the default for `hrbrthemes::theme_ipsum_rc()` and `camiller::theme_din()`. Source Sans Pro also works. 

You can use any of these with `sysfonts::font_add_google()` and `showtext::showtext_auto()`. Make sure to also run `showtext_opts(dpi = 300)` so nothing weird happens (major source of headaches this summer for me). 

# Colors

There are two main (related) points to consider in choosing colors: accessibility and semantic meaning. 

### Accessibility

Colorblindness affects around 1/12 of those with a single X chromosome (the male sex), and around 1 in 200 of those who have 2 X chromosomes. Some of the most common forms of colorblindness include protanopia and deuteranopia, or red-green colorblindness, and tritanopia, or reduced blue light sensitivity.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="49%", out.height="25%",fig.cap="Standard vision (top left), deuternaopia (top right), and proteranopia (bottom).",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
#can't find where i put the code for this lol
knitr::include_graphics(c("examples/colors/iris_colors_base.png",
                          "examples/colors/iris_colors_deut.png", 
                          "examples/colors/iris_colors_pro.png"))
``` 

Picking colors like red and green in a single plot can make it difficult or impossible to distinguish colors on that chart. Even in cases where it is possible to distinguish colors, the trends we want to highlight may lose impact or change meaning if the colors change drastically. To ensure that our graphics are accessible as possible, you should choose easily distinguishable colors and review your plots in software like [Sim Daltonism](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sim-daltonism/id693112260?mt=12) (Mac) or [ColourSimulations](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/coloursimulations/9nblggh4385h) (Windows) before publishing. 

### Semantic meaning 

The other dimension to color choices is the semantic meaning colors can have, or in other words the message that a combination of colors can send. Some scales can be used to match intuitive notions of a metric — for example, I can color towns with a “good” COVID-19 response green, “okay” as yellow, and “bad” as red. Others need more caution — for instance, red and blue are often associated with Republican/Democrat divisions, which can be useful in showing explicitly political trends (who won in this town in 2016?) but harmful for characterizing other divisions (is this a low-income or high-income town?). Still other divisions similarly play into cultural norms and color association, but should in almost every case be avoided when discussing their associated dimensions (e.g., don’t use pink and blue for gender). 

```{r}

gender_dta <- tibble(Gender = "Men", Height = 10:1) %>% 
  bind_rows(
    tibble(Gender = "Women", Height = 4*(1:10)^.3),
    tibble(Gender= "Nonbinary", Height = seq(1,2,length.out = 10))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(Weight = rep(1:10, 3))
bad_sexist <- ggplot(gender_dta, aes(x = Weight, y = Height, color = Gender)) + 
  geom_line(size = 2) + 
  labs(title = "Bad: Reinforces sexist gender stereotypes") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("skyblue", "green3","pink2"))
bad_confusing <- ggplot(gender_dta, aes(x = Weight, y = Height, color = Gender)) + 
  geom_line(size = 2) + 
  labs(title = "Usually Bad: Connotations can confuse") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("pink2","green3","skyblue"))
maybe_good <- ggplot(gender_dta, aes(x = Weight, y = Height, color = Gender)) + 
  geom_line(size = 2) + 
  labs(title = "Better: Just uses different colors :)",
       caption = "Please don't pay attention to the axis titles or the actual values, I'm not creative") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#0B3954","#FF7F11", "#C94277")) 
gender_plot <- plot_grid(bad_sexist, bad_confusing, maybe_good,
          ncol = 1) 
ggsave("examples/gender_plot.png", plot = gender_plot, width = 6, height =8, dpi = 300)

```

![](examples/gender_plot.png)

Broader connotations outside of any specific combination of colors should also be considered. Noticeably brighter or darker colors generally stick out more, which can be very useful when highlighting a certain trend. Bright red might be connoted with “wrong” no matter what other colors are used. Blue and green are called “cool” colors because of their emotional connotation. 

### More useful information

Here are some go-to categorical palettes that can be your starting point: 

```{r}
#this function shows set of cols in a ggplot2 way
ggpal <- function(pal, title = NULL){
  tibble(width = 1:length(pal), height = 1, pal = pal) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = width, y = height, fill = pal)) + 
    geom_tile() + 
    geom_text(label = pal, family = "Source Sans Pro", size = 2.5) + 
    scale_fill_manual(values = set_names(pal)) + 
    theme_bw() + 
    labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = NULL, title = title) + 
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank(), 
          axis.ticks = element_blank(), panel.border =  element_blank(), legend.position = "none") 
}

# 1 color
col11 <- ggpal("#00A796")
col12 <- ggpal("#104E8B")
# 2 colors
col21 <- ggpal(c("#F0B537", "#C15FA5"))
col22 <- ggpal(c("#00A796", "#F68B33"))
# 3 colors
col31 <- ggpal(c("#75BEE9","#F3716D","#C15FA5"))
col32 <- ggpal(c("#99C945", "#CC61B0", "#2F8AC4"))
#4
col41 <- ggpal(c("#00A796", "#F3716D","#C15FA5", "#75BEE9"))
col42 <- ggpal(c("#F68B33", "#0077C1","#00A796","#C05FA5"))
#5
col51 <- ggpal(c("#00A796", "#F17060", "#C15FA5", "#F0B537", "#75BEE9"))
col52 <- ggpal(c("#008080", "#92B69E", "#F6EDBD", "#E6A272", "#CA562C")) 

plot_lab <- function(lab){
  ggdraw() + draw_label(lab, fontfamily = "Source Sans Pro", 
                        size = 8, hjust = 0, x=  0)
} 
qual_pals <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_lab("One color"),
  col11, col12,
  plot_lab("Two colors"),
  col21, col22, 
  plot_lab("Three colors"),
  col31, col32, 
  plot_lab("Four colors"),
  col41, col42, 
  plot_lab("Five colors"),
  col51, col52, 
  ncol = 1
) 

ggsave("examples/qualitative_palettes.png", plot = qual_pals, width = 3, height =5, dpi = 300)
```

![](examples/qualitative_palettes.png)

Cases where more than five colors are truly needed are rare. You can usually combine colors or drop the use of colors entirely in these scenarios. In the situations where they are indeed necessary or useful, check out the palettes in `rcartocolor` or `RColorBrewer` for expansive options. The above palettes were also made by combining and modifying palettes from these libraries.

For sequential palettes, you can try:

```{r}

seq_pals <- cowplot::plot_grid(
  plot_lab("RColorBrewer, Greens"),
  ggpal(brewer_pal(palette = "Greens")(7)), 
  plot_lab("RColorBrewer, Blues"),
  ggpal(brewer_pal(palette= "Blues")(7)),
  plot_lab("rcartocolor, PurpOr"),
  ggpal(carto_pal(n=7, "PurpOr")), 
  plot_lab("'PurpYl'? A (not yet officially named) palette by Camille"), 
  ggpal(c('#f0eeaa','#ddd3b3','#c7b9b9','#aea0bc','#938abb','#7475b3','#4c669b')), 
  ncol = 1
) 


ggsave("examples/seq_palettes.png", plot = seq_pals, width = 3.5, height =3.5, dpi = 300)

```

![](examples/seq_palettes.png)

If you need to use a continuous palette instead, you should instead first consider if you can bin your data and use a sequential palette instead. It's often hard for the human eye to look at a certain color and think "4", but look at a darker shade and know if it means "6" or "600". It's much easier to make this judgment if there are a few set options to match colors to. 

If for whatever reason you must use a continuous palette, a safe option is to use the color scales in `viridis` or to turn one of the scales above into a continuous palette inside `ggplot2::scale_color_gradient` by setting `low=` and `high=` appropriately. 

# Guides for Individual Geoms

*Geom* is `ggplot2` lingo for "geometric object" or "the type of symbols that represent the data." Geoms differentiate scatter plots from line plots, bar plots from box plots, and so on. 

This section offers advice on how to choose between different geoms. 

### Bar plots (`geom_bar` and `geom_col`)

**Bar plots are one of DataHaven's quintessential plots.** Both stacked bar plots and "dodge"d^[meaning bars in a group are side by side] bar plots are useful for showing within- and between-group differences in data -- it's easy to look at a bar plot and see that one bar is taller than the others. Because of this, bar plots are a generally reliable go-to option when dealing with data that have at least one continuous variable and one categorical variable. Stacked bar plots in particular are a good way to represent "shares of a whole," as in example 3. 

With bar plots, you should try to make sure that the continuous axis begins at zero with `lims()`. Differences and disparities with bar plots can be easily misinterpreted by just adjusting the minimum value of the y-axis -- see example 3. 

### Line plots (`geom_line` and `geom_smooth`)

**Line plots should be used to emphasize a trend of the same object over some ordered measure.** Just the act of connecting multiple dots is itself a pointed statement — you argue that there is an underlying trend, instead of opting to let the data “speak for itself” as one might try with a scatter plot. 

Like any plot, you should always work to simplify the information your plot shows. As opposed to creating a “cloud” of lines for every block group in Connecticut (see example 1), a more reasonable option might be using a 95% confidence interval of the mean to show a clear and convincing trend. 

This can be difficult if the data you want to plot is all over the place. Aggregation, like the 7-day rolling average in example 2, can be helpful for this purpose. `geom_smooth` can also help pull out a trend from messy data, but this is less optimal because [finish]

### Maps (`geom_sf`)

**Maps should be used when the trend in question is explicitly geographic.** When maps are used, you should:

* Ask how the dimension of geography helps better understand the data. Is it a geographic process, something that is useful to see as concentrated within a few areas, or something that varies more erratically? Why would it help to see that an area has a certain value through a map, as opposed to a line plot or a scatter plot? 
* Set polygon boundaries to an appropriately small size and color. They should be visible but very subtle, and not detract at all from the colored interior. This is especially important for a larger map with many small shapes, for example a map of U.S. counties, where the borders around each shape can distract from or make it difficult to see the colored interior or points of interest. You should also consider a distinct border around the outer edge of the entire map (i.e. outline Connecticut in a plot of CT towns). 
* Be extremely cautious about colors! Whereas five colors might be able to be used with extreme caution in bar plots and line plots, even just two different colors can be difficult for a map. A sequential or continuous scale usually works well, but a diverging scale can be confusing and a map with a categorical scale may especially cluttered if more than two colors are used. 

Also, there are some other ways to make maps that float around on blogs, including using `geom_polygon`, `ggmap`, or just base R's `plot`, but `geom_sf` is by far the best option. Compared to other shape formats, `sf` objects integrate with tidyverse syntax easily (e.g. spatial joins in `sf` have near-identical syntax with regular `dplyr` table joins) and `geom_sf` in particular flexibly handles all of polygons, multipolygons, and points. 

### Scatter plots (`geom_point` and `geom_jitter`, sometimes)

**Scatter plots should be used sparingly when the above options fail, or when there is not an explicit trend to emphasize.** `geom_point` and `geom_jitter` are useful for data with at least one continuous variable. They can communicate at once a trend and give an intuitive display of the variance or margin of error in the data, and come the close to showing the data "as it is" where a line plot might instead push the reader to see a trend. 

However, this minimalist "as it is" aspect of scatter plots is also a reason to stay away from them. To make sure our public-facing graphics can be understood by many, the message our plots convey should often be explicit and simple. It's hard to do this with scatter plots, where points can easily clutter the plot or overload the reader with information. Scatter plots should thus be used when the point of emphasis is not a trend itself, or when the trend is too complex to show through a line plot or bar plot. 

One example is in Fig 1.4 of the DataHaven 2019 Community Index reports, which gives a general profile of Connecticut towns, their well-being index, their community index, and their neighborhood asset index. 

### Other geoms?

**You probably shouldn't use many other geoms.** Again, DataHaven's public-facing plots are meant to be readable. This means that some of the stranger geoms in the `ggplot2` library are often not used. Box plots and violin plots are generally not used in DataHaven graphics, and neither are density plots, correlation plots, or dendrograms. Limiting the types of different plots we make and thus focusing on interpretability can often do much more work than pushing another insight out of our dataset with a different geom. 

Still, these are just guidelines. Each new type of geom does provide insight, and assuming that a certain type of plot is not "readable" can tie into a different form of epistemological violence on the people we serve^[I promise to never say "epistemological violence" again]. Some types of data might not be easily seen through the few types of geoms cited above -- for example, a dataset showing opioid overdoses in certain towns over the past ten years might be better seen through an animated map than static map, bar chart, or line plot. Although this has the potential in overloading readers with information, it can provide new insight and the "cool" factor involved in an animated map might make it a good candidate for a Twitter graphic where regular plots might not be as engaging. 

In other words, like everything in this guide, take this set of recommendations with a handful of salt. Your own knowledge is ultimately worth much more in any scenario than the jumble thoughts of an opinionated sophomore in college who has never worked a real job.
