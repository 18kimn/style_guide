* **Title.**  In almost every graphic, the title should be a noticeable statement that aids in interpretation. This means that it should ideally be a sentence that states a conclusion — instead of “Preventable hospital visits across age and gender,” a better title could be “Preventable hospital visits show large differences across age and gender.” It should be in bold and be the biggest piece of text in the plot (18 or larger), and left-aligned at the top of the plot. 
* **Subtitle.** The subtitle should be a qualifier that adds context or detail to the title. It should be the second-largest piece of text in the plot, and left-aligned just below the plot title. It should also be noticeably different from the plot title; usually this can be accomplished by just using plain (as opposed to bold) face, but you can also use capital case or a different color if necessary. 
* **Caption.** The caption functions similarly to the subtitle in adding context and detail, but is useful more for information that the user might not need immediately. These include  credits to the maker of the data and/or graphic. Many graphics might not need captions and might function better without them if they add clutter; for example, there are very few captions for DataHaven’s 2019 CWI and most of this information is instead stored in footnotes at the end of the report. When they are used, they should be right-aligned and smaller than the subtitle and axis labels. 
* **Axis titles.** Contrary to what your science teachers might tell you, axis titles are actually *not always needed.* If the x-axis only has four slots for “Asian”, “Black”, “Latino”, and “white”, you shouldn’t use “Race” as an axis title because it only adds clutter instead of useful information. This is especially true if the title of the plot primes the user for information the axis title might convey-- for example, if the title was “Pandemic-related income loss has hit non-white adults hardest" and the x-axis was "race." 
  + Still, in some cases they are necessary. Amounts of money as tick marks could mean median household income, income per capita, cost of living in a town, or others, and it may be impossible to distinguish based on context. In these cases, axis titles should be bigger than the axis tick labels but smaller than the plot title. Choosing the same size as the plot subtitle is usually a safe bet. They should be concise. 
* **Axis tick labels.** Axis tick labels should be formatted in a "friendly" manner. Use dollar signs, commas as thousand separators, and use decimal points judiciously. Especially important are tick labels where the peaks or valleys of the plots might be -- other tick labels aren't as important. You generally don't need more than four tick labels per plot.
* **Legend text.** Legend text is useful to distinguish groups on the same page. But legends can also add clutter and it can be annoying for readers to constantly switch looking at the plot and the legend. Adding the legend text onto the plot itself as an annotation can be much more effective. 
* **Annotations.** Besides acting as a legend as we see in the two plots above, annotations can be helpful to highlight specific groups or point out special cases. In a line plot of Connecticut towns, we might want to highlight the “overall” line or the “New Haven” line. Annotations can assist in this effort. 
  + Because annotations go directly onto the plot, it can be really easy to add clutter and obscure the message the facets show. When annotations are used in the plot whitespace, they should be relatively small (around the same size as the axis tick labels, or smaller) and be extremely short. 
* **Logo.** The DataHaven logo goes on plots that are not part of a long report but may reach a large audience. These might include Twitter graphics or in an op-ed. It should go in the bottom left corner beneath the axis labels and caption (i.e., at the very bottom of the plot). Use cowplot::plot_grid() to align the logo consistently across plots; a ratio of 10:1 for plot:logo height is safe for most rectangular plots.
